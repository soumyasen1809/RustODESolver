# ODE Solver in Rust

## Overview

This project is an ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) solver implemented in Rust. It provides a simple and efficient way to solve differential equations numerically using various methods such as Euler's method, Runge-Kutta methods, and more.

## Features

- **Multiple Solvers**: Includes implementations of Euler's method, Runge-Kutta methods (RK4), Heun Method and more.
- **Flexible Interface**: Easily define your differential equations and initial conditions.
- **Extensible**: Designed to be easily extended with new solving methods.

## Usage
For a basic example of how to use the ODE solver, check the main.rs file.
